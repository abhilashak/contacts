== Welcome to Contacts Gem

Contacts is a universal interface to grab contact list information from various providers including Hotmail, AOL, Gmail, Plaxo and Yahoo.

== Download

* https://github.com/abhilashak/contacts
* git clone git@github.com:abhilashak/contacts.git

== Usage

In Gemfile

gem "contacts", :git => "git://github.com/abhilashak/contacts.git"
gem "gdata", :git => "git://github.com/dwaite/gdata.git"

== Background

This gem is based on cardmagic contacts. https://github.com/cardmagic/contacts, and I patched some files in this gem and replaced the hotmail.rb file with deneuxa's contacts (https://github.com/deneuxa/contacts) to work the Hotmail importing.

While I am using the gem contacts for importing the contacts from gmail, yahoo and hotmail, I encountered Three-Four Problems (Major One: Hotmail importing is not working), the first error I got is the following,

/home/prescience-toshiba/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@rails31rc/gems/activesupport-3.1.3/lib/active_support/dependencies.rb:240:in `require': no such file to load -- hpricot (LoadError)

so I patched in the file /home/prescience-toshiba/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@rails31rc/gems/contacts-1.2.4/lib/contacts/aol.rb

and replaced the line 

require 'hpricot'

with

require 'hpricot' if RUBY_VERSION < '1.9'

this is valid for only the ruby version less than 1.9


then I changed

the file  /home/prescience-toshiba/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p290@rails31rc/gems/gdata-1.1.1/lib/gdata.rb

replaced this line 

require 'jcode' 

with

require 'jcode' if RUBY_VERSION < '1.9'	

If any warning message comes with $KCODE when starting the server or starting the console then

replace

$KCODE = 'UTF8'

with

$KCODE = 'UTF8' if RUBY_VERSION < '1.9'  in the file gdata.rb

For the Hotmail importing issue, I replaced the hotmail.rb file from cardmagic contacts with deneuxa's contacts hotmail.rb file.

And Hotmail Authentication error is the issue shown in https://github.com/cardmagic/contacts/issues/42

Contacts::ConnectionError: Hotmail has changed its protocols, please upgrade this library first. If that does not work, report this error at http://rubyforge.org/forum/?group_id=2693

When I tried to use the gem  deneuxa-contacts gem, so many gem conflict error came. Hope this updated contacts gem will help you better.

== Usage

	Contacts::Hotmail.new(login, password).contacts # => [["name", "foo@bar.com"], ["another name", "bow@wow.com"]]
	Contacts::Yahoo.new(login, password).contacts
	Contacts::Gmail.new(login, password).contacts
	
	Contacts.new(:gmail, login, password).contacts
	Contacts.new(:hotmail, login, password).contacts
	Contacts.new(:yahoo, login, password).contacts
	
	Contacts.guess(login, password).contacts
